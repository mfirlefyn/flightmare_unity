## Getting to Know the Unity Renderer

Taken from the original [RPG Flightmare Unity](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/flightmare_unity) repository.

RPG Flightmare Unity is a [Unity](https://unity.com/) project for building the photorealistic image renderering engine of the [Flightmare simulator](https://github.com/mfirlefyn/flightmare).

This documentation is not meant as a guide such was the case in the installation in Flightmare. Since the Unity renderer binary has been provided on the [Releases](https://github.com/mfirlefyn/flightmare/releases) page.   

Instead, this repository is meant to give developers the change to make their own environment for the Unity renderer and Flightmare simulator using the tools that we have developed. The main changes accumulate in the "CameraController.cs" Flightmare script asset and the "TerrainEditor.cs" asset. They deal with the implementation of the different flight phases used in the Flightmare simulation and the procedural generation of the simulated forest environment respectively.

Note that you will not be able to run the code in this repository on its own. This has to do with the fact that Github will not allow the upload of the full repository since it is way too big memory-wise. Although, we will give you some pointers to start working with the Unity environment. Unity has some good tutorials for you to get started on their website.

## Some Pointers on How to Get Started With Your Development

First, you will have to install [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html#install-hub-linux). You will probably need to set up a Unity account first.

If you have installed Unity Hub, you can continue by cloning either our Unity renderer from this repository or the original one. The original one would be a better starting point since you will not have to deal with the dependency issues you will encounter with our repository. 

Assuming you would want to build a forest environment with free assets from the Unity asset store, like we did, here is a list of all the used assets:
* [Outdoor Ground Textures](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/outdoor-ground-textures-12555#content)
* [Conifers](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/conifers-botd-142076)
* [Grass Flowers](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/nature/grass-flowers-pack-free-138810#content)
* [Terrain Sample Asset Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/terrain-sample-asset-pack-145808)

Also, The inherent Unity terrain tools make it relatively simple to make your own terrain manually without any procedural generation. Just be aware that after the terrain asset is generated by the terrain tool, it is not really usable as a scene in concatenation with the Flightmare simulator. At least, we did not get it to work correctly. A suspicion of the culprit could lay in the way Unity handles occlusion culling in between frame updates.

A workaround that we used is to build the terrain using the terrain tools, either manually or procedurally generated and convert the terrain asset to a mesh gameObject afterwards. If you would like to do this as well, you can use this paid asset from the asset store (This is not a recommendation or an ad in any way, it is just meant to be helpful tool in development. We have no affiliation or income of any kind from the author of this tool.):
* [Terrain To Mesh](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/terrain-to-mesh-195349)

Again, we recommend you to explore and gain more experience in Unity to build your own meshes from scratch. If you are experiencing time constraints, the Terrain To Mesh tool can be helpful for you.
